# Machine Learning Productionization

Moving Machine Learning models into production is as important as building them, sometime even harder. Maintaining data quality and model accuracy over time are just a few of the challenges. To achieve the end-to-end system productionization as a whole, the various components and design need to be identified, from defining a problem to serve the model as a service.

This chapter combines the foundational concepts of machine learning with the functional expertise of modern software development and engineering to help you develop production-ready Machine Learning knowledge.
