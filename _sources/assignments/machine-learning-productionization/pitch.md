# Pitch session

In this session/assignment, you should come up with a Machine Learning Project idea.

Each student should, in the next session, present your idea with
- either a project plan following [this template](overview.ipynb),
- or, a slide of around 10 pages. [This one can be an example for you to follow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gTK27XUOC12X8PpggB8_NGxVOAPeYV3I5W6QTYIp49U/edit#slide=id.gcb9a0b074_1_0).

Your presentation should be limited to around 3 minutes.

After the pitch, projects receiving the most votes would "survive".
You will then form groups of 3-4 students, each group sharing one common project.


You will present your midterm work in this manner:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmDEWyf648c&list=PLZSO_6-bSqHQ_29JS5GnZdK0yTS53dWib&index=17

And at the end of the project, you will present your work in this manner:
